mytext[4]="APA: I understand, gentlemen. However, as part of our investigation, we need to see the status of the animals." 
mytext[5]=" This is standard on all reports we receive." 
mytext[6]="Julio: Of course, we understand. But I would like to explain something that may have generated this complaint, huh, love?" 
mytext[7]="Clara: Yes, my dear. Well sir, we are building a leisure area in our backyard" 
mytext[8]="and the workers' noises could have been mistaken for animal screams."
mytext[9]="APA: Ah, I get it. Noise can be misinterpreted. It's good to know you're just improving your home" 
mytext[10]="but we need to check the animals anyway." 
mytext[11]="Julio: Well, actually, they're at a friend's house while we do some yard work."
mytext[12]="We didn't want them to be stressed by the noise and mess." 
mytext[13]="APA: Well... It sounds like you're really worried about your pets, but let your neighbors know it's just construction work" 
mytext[14]="but first we want to go in to really find out."
mytext[15]="Julio: Of course, Agent Silva, come in, you'll see they're not here."
mytext[16]="Julio: See, they're not here, Agent Silva."
mytext[17]="APA: It looks like you really took steps to ensure the comfort of the animals during construction."
mytext[18]="We didn't find any animals here, as you mentioned, we're leaving now."
